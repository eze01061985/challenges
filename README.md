Instructions for Running the Code - Finding the Minimum Difference and Non-Constructible Change

Finding the Minimum Difference
This Java code finds the minimum difference between two arrays of integers. Below are the steps to execute the code:

Prerequisites
Before running the code, make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Java Development Kit (JDK): Ensure you have a version of Java installed on your computer. You can download the JDK from the official Oracle website or use an OpenJDK distribution.
Steps to Run the Code
Download the Source Code: Download the source code from this repository. You can do this by clicking the "Code" button at the top of this page and selecting "Download ZIP." Then, unzip the ZIP file to a location of your choice.

Open a Terminal (Console): Open a terminal or console on your operating system. On Unix-based systems (Linux and macOS), you can use the built-in Terminal. On Windows, you can use Command Prompt or PowerShell.

Navigate to the Code Folder: Use the cd command to navigate to the folder where you unzipped the source code. For example, if you unzipped the code on your desktop, you can navigate to the directory like this (replace <code-path> with the actual location):

bash
Copy code
cd <code-path>
Compile the Code: Use the following command to compile the Java code:

bash
Copy code
javac SmallestDifference.java
This will generate a SmallestDifference.class file.

Run the Program: Once compiled, you can run the program like this:

bash
Copy code
java SmallestDifference
The program will execute and calculate the minimum difference between the example arrays.

Result: The program will display the result in the console, which is the minimum difference found between the arrays.
